# Mustafa Şentürk
> Software Developer | MSc Computational Science | Naval Architect

I followed my childhood dream and began my career as a design engineer. Having seen the problems facing the industry, I joined the civil service as a maritime specialist to help improve the shipbuilding and maritime industry and to gain a broader perspective of the industry. During my time in the Civil Service, I was overwhelmed by the problems that could be solved through the design and development of computational solutions, digital transformation, and the advancement of the rules-as-code concept. I studied Applied Mathematics & Computer Science. I enjoy design and development of unqiue solutions.
