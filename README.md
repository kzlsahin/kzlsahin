I followed my childhood dream and began my career as a design engineer. Having seen the problems facing the industry, I joined the civil service as a maritime specialist to help improve the shipbuilding and maritime industry and to gain a broader perspective of the industry. During my time in the Civil Service, I was overwhelmed by the problems that could be solved through the design and development of computational solutions, digital transformation, and the advancement of the rules-as-code concept. I studied Applied Mathematics & Computer Science. I enjoy design and development of unqiue solutions.

## NuGet Packages

#### SI Units library for dimensional arithmetic
[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SIUnitsArithmetic?label=Latest%20Version)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIUnitsArithmetic/)[![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/SIUnitsArithmetic)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIUnitsArithmetic/)[![github repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/github_repo-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/kzlsahin/SiUnitsArithmetic)

> SIUnitsArithmetic defines metric system units and provides related arithmetic operations, including unit-to-unit multiplication, even with derived units of any combination of base units, resulting in higher or lower order units (m², 1/m or m/s).

#### Floating Point Control for Windows Presentation Forms
[![NuGet Package Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FloatingPointControl?label=Latest%20Version)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FloatingPointControl/)[![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/FloatingPointControl)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FloatingPointControl/)[![github repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/github_repo-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/kzlsahin/floating-point-controls)

> There is no built-in control for floating-point inputs in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Using TextBox for managing floating-point inputs can be a challange for a developer. If all you need is a floating-point input with seamless WPF compatibility, this package is for you.
