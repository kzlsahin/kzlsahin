Despite how it is called, Naval Architecture is an engineering discipline with strong foundations in physics, mathematics and materials science focused on design and construction of marine vessels. And that is where I came from.

I've always had a strong desire to create and innovate. I realized that software development offered a much broader platform for me to do just that. The dynamic nature of the field, the ability to build complex systems from the ground up, and the constant evolution of technology really attracted me. I saw software development as an opportunity to apply my problem-solving skills and design thinking in a more impactful way.

I really enjoy studying Computer Science and philosophy of software development. It is amazing to witness the emergence of such impressive systems above layers of abstractions, from logic circuits to networks.

While I value my experience in naval architecture, I'm excited to pursue my passion for software development, where I can innovate and contribute to shaping the digital world.

## NuGet Packages

#### SI Units library for dimensional arithmetic
[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SIUnitsArithmetic?label=Latest%20Version)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIUnitsArithmetic/)[![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/SIUnitsArithmetic)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SIUnitsArithmetic/)[![github repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/github_repo-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/kzlsahin/SiUnitsArithmetic)

> SIUnitsArithmetic defines metric system units and provides related arithmetic operations, including unit-to-unit multiplication, even with derived units of any combination of base units, resulting in higher or lower order units (m², 1/m or m/s).

#### Floating Point Control for Windows Presentation Forms
[![NuGet Package Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FloatingPointControl?label=Latest%20Version)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FloatingPointControl/)[![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/FloatingPointControl)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FloatingPointControl/)[![github repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/github_repo-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/kzlsahin/floating-point-controls)

> There is no built-in control for floating-point inputs in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Using TextBox for managing floating-point inputs can be a challange for a developer. If all you need is a floating-point input with seamless WPF compatibility, this package is for you.
