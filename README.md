Hi, I’m @kzlsahin, Naval Architect and Marine Engineer with extensive interest in computer and computational science, working as a design engineer for a yacht design office. I like to hack problems and develop creative solutions.

- I’m currently MSc student in Computational Science and Engineering studying on dynamical systems,

- I'm quite interested in Rules-As-Code studies, which I would like to study at academic level.
